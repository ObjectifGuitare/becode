## 3. <a name='Respectforplanningbeinglateabsence'></a>üïë Respect for planning: being late & absence

In case of **delay**, **absence** or **early leave** (planned or not), you will need to warn us.

In short here is what you do in any of the three cases above:

1. Send a message to _all_ your coach(es) by mail (and perhaps Discord too)
2. Warn BeCode through [my.becode.org](https://my.becode.org/):
   - If you already have some note to justify your absence (eg. a doctor's note), then send this straight to us using the platform (my.becode.org);
   - If you know that you are going to obtain such document, tell us when you notify us of your absence. Once you have the document, send it to us through the platform;
   - When you know that you will have no legal reason for the absence or delay then please let us know <abbr title="As Soon As Possible">ASAP</abbr> as well on Discord. Not showing up or showing up late is considered unprofessional.

---

- 2 unjustified occasions of being late or leaving early is seen as an absence
- 2 unjustified absences leads to a one-on-one conversation
- 6 unjustified absences leads to a termination of your contract with us {and the vdab} and results in you leaving this training permanently.
- If the absence rate (justified or not) exceeds 20%, BeCode may decide on the final exclusion of the learner.
