# Git & Github

## What are they?

**Git** is a version control system. It is a necessary tool for every self-respecting developer. It enables you to log every change within a project in detail and to work together in the same file at the same time.

**GitHub** is an online platform _made on top of_ Git. It gives you an online interface that has the same features as Git.
It also serves as a place to put your code. It is one of the biggest online developer community.
