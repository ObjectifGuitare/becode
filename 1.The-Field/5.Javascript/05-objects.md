# Algorithmics with JavaScript 05 - Objects

Objects are some other type of data structure in JavaScript.

## Theory

### Simple objects

At the very base they are quite a simple structure like arrays. Instead of assigning an index to each element they allow to assign them to a string. That string will be called the *key* and its associated value will be the... value.

```javascript
let myObject = {
  // we can use the "" notation for the key
  "firstname": "Gerard",
  // ... or just specify it this way if we want
  name: "Lambert",
  // we can use any type for the value
  age: 42
};

// we can use the [] notation to access values
console.log(myObject["age"]); // 25

// ... or the . notation
console.log(myObject.firstname); // Gerard

// we can assign a new value
myObject.age = 54;

// ... and there's a special keyword to delete keys
delete myObject["name"];

console.log(myObject); // {firstname: "Gerard", age: 54}
```

### Objects and Arrays as Tools for Data Structures

By combining objects, arrays and a few simple types we can represent complex data structures suitable to represent most type of data.

```javascript
{
  firstname: "Gerard",
  lastname: "Lambert",
  age: 42,
  skills: [
    {
      skillName: "JavaScript",
      level: "advanced"
    },
    {
      skillName: "HTML",
      level: "advanced"
    }
  ],
  address: {
    street: "rue des Campanules",
    number: "10",
    city: "Paris",
    zip: 1000
  }
}
```

This also form the basis of [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON), a data format inspired by JavaScript which is used in almost every programming language nowadays.

## Exercises

### Exercise 5.0

Create an array 

### Exercise 5.1

Create a function named `askTvSerie()` that will ask the user for the following data about its favorite TV serie:

* Name
* Production year
* Names of the cast members (there can be as much as the user want)

That function must gather all the data in a single object and return it. The data structure must be elegant.

Create a program that use that function to generate a TV serie object and display it to the user in JSON format.

### Exercise 5.2

Create a function named `randomizeCast(tvSerie)` that will take as argument the data structure you defined in the previous exercise and return a list of the same cast but in a random order.

Create a program that will use `randomizeCast(tvSerie)` and `askTvSerie()` to ask the user about a TV serie then display a randomized list of the previous cast that will form the new cast of your next serie.
